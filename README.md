#Lab 2.5 - RSA from Scratch

## Objective

1. Write a program to generate RSA keys
2. Incorporate existing code into a new project using import statements

## Getting Started

1. Using your random number generator, you will write a program to generate a public and private RSA key.
2.  **Create a new file for RSA and import your generate random number function using import statements.** Your final submission should have **four files(RSA, random number generator, Miller-Rabin primality test, and extended Euclidean algorithm.**
3. Write comments describing the purpose and use of each of your functions
4. For values of e, use 3 or 5 for small numbers and 65537 for larger keys
